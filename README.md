# Sentency Server

The server will be done using Javalin, a simple web framework for Java and Kotlin.

## Third-Party Libraries

Javalin come with built-in libraries but it's mostly a "plug what you need" type of framework, because of that we had to 
add some third party libraries to fill some gaps:

* [Javalin](https://javalin.io/): a simple web framework for Java and Kotlin
* [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) : an ORM framework for Kotlin created by JetBrains
